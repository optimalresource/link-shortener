This is a working link shortener project. Anyone can replicate it and use. The only reason why I had to do this was because basic services like knowing how many times someone clicks your link is not available for free on other providers I figured out.

## Getting Started

Clone the repo.

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
